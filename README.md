# MAPS-WG
The PCC Working Group on Metadata Application Profiles is charged to:
  * Oversee the creation and maintenance of PCC Metadata Application Profiles that meet the following criteria:
    * Represent a “floor” for PCC metadata descriptions
    * Are (to the extent possible) capable of bi-directional transformation between a human-readable format and machine-readable structures such as ShEx and SHACL that can be used to validate RDF graphs
    * Support both MARC 21 and Linked Data workflows
    * Are based on the following assumptions regarding PCC data:
      * Transmitted and stored in various RDF serializations
      * Resource Description and Access (RDA) as content standard
      * BIBFRAME as the initial base data model
    * Are “open”, i.e. that accept and store any triples not described in the schema
    * As far as possible, use existing profiles (BSR/CSR, PCC Sinopia profiles) as a foundation for building out PCC profiles
  * Cultivate expertise in Metadata Application Profile design and functionality within PCC
  * Collaborate with the relevant PCC standing committees as needed
  * Communicate with and perform outreach to stakeholders (library services platform and discovery service vendors, data remediation services, other creators of profiles in the cultural heritage sector)
  * After the development of BIBFRAME base profiles, the group may explore other data models for PCC use, in consultation with PoCo via SCS chairs.

# Metadata Application Profiles created by the PCC MAPs Working Group
This site provides access to the following:
  * Sinopia templates for cataloging according to PCC standards:
    * books
    * serials
  * human-readable spreadsheet versions of those templates
  * other MAPs as are ready for use (currently working on BSR for Official RDA)
